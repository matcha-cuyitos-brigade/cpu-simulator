# What is this?
ðŸŽ› A simple CPU simulation that reads its configurations from a bios.yml and interprets assembly-like code files.

## Components
### CU
A Control Unit is responsible of fetching the instruction set, controlling the data flow across the whole CPU,  controls the timing of each operation and the interaction with peripheral devices. 

### ALU
Arithmetic Logic Unit, is a digital electronic circuit responsible for (depending on the processor) doing all the arithmetic operations such as (but not limited to): 
* Add
* Subtraction
* Subtract with borrow
* Oneâ€™s complement
* Twoâ€™s complement
* AND
* OR
* Bit shift operations

### REGISTERS
An important piece of memory that the CU and the ALU can store temporarily the data, one important register is the program counter which keeps track  of where the CPU is reading from the instruction set.

* Instruction Register (Current instruction loaded)
* Instruction Address Register (program counter)

### RAM
Random Access Memory

### Clock
In charge of control the fetch-decode-execute cycle.

## How to run
clone the repo to your computer using: 
   ```bash
git clone <git link>
```
now, it is important that you have docker and you're using unix

use the following commands to access the project and start the docker container

 ```bash
cd cpu-simulator && bash start.sh
```
next, enter the following commands
 ```bash
cd cpu-simulator/source && pipenv run python3 SimulatorCLI.py
```
that commanmd runs CLI on a virtual environment, please note that you need to have pipenv installed

if you wish to run it without docker and only using flask on a virtual environment, use this command:

```bash
cd cpu-simulator/source && pipenv run python3 Simulator.py
```
please note that you still need to have pipenv installed and use a unix based terminal.
